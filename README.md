## 🗃️ Database Design

### Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
The schema is intuitive and scalable, clearly defining how customers, orders, and products interrelate. This logical structure is the backbone for all complex reporting.

### Normalization
The database adheres to **Third Normal Form (3NF)**, ensuring data is stored without unnecessary duplication. This makes the database efficient, consistent, and easier to maintain.

## 🛡️ Security & Performance

**Security is integrated into the design:**
*   **Parameterized Stored Procedures:** Used for all key operations, effectively preventing SQL injection attacks.
*   **Role-Based Views:** Designed to restrict data access, ensuring users can only see relevant information (e.g., customers seeing only their orders).

**Performance is tuned for analytics:**
*   **Strategic Indexing:** Indexes on columns like `payment_date` and `customer_id` ensure that sales reports and customer history queries run quickly, even on large datasets.
*   **Optimized Query Writing:** Queries are structured for efficiency, using appropriate `JOINs` and `WHERE` clauses to minimize execution time.

## 💾 Backup & Recovery Strategy

For any business, data is invaluable. This project includes a practical backup plan:
*   **Automated Full Backups:** Scheduled regularly to capture the entire database.
*   **Frequent Transaction Log Backups:** Enable point-in-time recovery, ensuring minimal data loss.
